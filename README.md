# Quasi-Static and Sub-Horizon Approximations in Modified Gravity

Files used to do all the computations in . You will find the following files:

1) Horndeski_Theory.nb: a Mathematica file containing the linear cosmological perturbations for the Horndeski model. You can find the perturbation equations for $f(R)$ theories in the section "Examples".

2) QSA_SHA_f(R).nb: a Mathematica file where the QSA and the SHA are applied to $f(R)$ theories. You will find two sections: $i)$ the standard procedure is executed, and $ii)$ the new parametrization is applied. 

3) fDES.nb: a Mathematica file where all the computations related to the $f$DES model are performed. In order to do the plots, you will need the data-files with the namefile "fDES_*.txt".

4) Hu_Sawicky.nb: a Mathematica file where all the computations related to the Hu-Sawicky model are performed. In order to do the plots, you will need the data-files with the namefile "HS_*.txt".

The data-files "base_ 2018_plikHM_TTTEEE_lowl_lowE_lensing00_pk.dat" and "base_2018_plikHM_TTTEEE_lowl_lowE_lensing00_cl.dat" contain data for the matter power spectrum and CMB angular power spectrum in the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model.
