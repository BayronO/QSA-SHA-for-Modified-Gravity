# Quasi-Static and Sub-Horizon Approximations in Modified Gravity

Files used to do all the computations in . You will find the following files:

1) Horndeski_Theory.nb: a Mathematica file containing the linear cosmological perturbations for the Horndeski model. You can find the perturbation equations for $f(R)$ theories in the section "Examples".

2) QSA_SHA_f(R).nb: a Mathematica file where the QSA and the SHA are applied to $f(R)$ theories. You will find two sections: $i)$ the standard procedure is executed, and $ii)$ the new parametrization is applied.
